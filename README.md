# Canopus

I aim to determine the altitude/azimuth of the Canopus and Sun seen from an observer in Tai Mountain from -2000 B.C.E to 0.
The position of the observer is assumed to be 117.1E, 36.2N, 1500 m.

The main procedures are listed as follow: 
(1) Calculate the time-dependent position of the Canopus in the ICRF2, using the position and proper motion data in Hipparcus catalog (Hipparcos, the New Reduction (van Leeuwen, 2007) ); 
(2) Calculate the time-dependent position of the Sun in the ICRF2; 
(3) Calculate the transformation metrix between ICRF2 and ITRF; 
(4) Determine the altitude/azimuth of the Canopus and Sun in a local coordinate system.
